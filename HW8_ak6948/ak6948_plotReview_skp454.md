1. The plot shows the frequency distribution of top 10 names of males and females in year 2016.
2. The plot adheres to basic standards for clarity i.e.:
    a. The axes are properly labeled
    b. The facets are properly titled
    c. The different names of males and females are clearly visible and are rotated at 45 degree which, enchances visibility.
3. The plot adheres to basic standards for esthetic too:
    a. The plot is used to present frequency distribution of categories thus, choice of bar graph is correct.
    b. The plot consist  of single color, blue; thus, will be easy to visualize for everyone.

Suggestions to further improve the plots:

1. The categories on the x-axes i.e. the names of males and females can be sorted in order of their frequency.
   This will show the decreasing order of frequency of names and will better reflect the underlying data distribution.
2. As the frequency count is a statistical measure. There are chances that the data may have statistical error.
   Thus the poisson measure of error(sqrt(N)) can be used to calculate error and all bar should have the errorbars alongwith it.
3. The actual data consists of many more names; A subset of the original data was used to create this plot and a lot of data was left wasted.
   However, this plot is appropriate to show top 10 names of males and females, a second plot which could show the histogram of counts of all names can better help to understand what portion of the original data are we visualizing in the current plot.
